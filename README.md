gmod_usersystem
===

This was a framework I was working on for a game called Garry's Mod. I've stopped working on it for the time being, but plan to (eventually) come back to it.

It was designed to create a user database for a gameserver; each user would have a set of statisitics (money, health, etc.) that would be tracked over multiple sessions. This way, a player would not have to "restart" each time they played on the server.

I started planning different roles that each player could have, but I didn't get too far there yet.
